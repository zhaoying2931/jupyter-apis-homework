# jupyter-apis-homework
 
####What is this?

This is my forth homework from the Lede Program.

The assignments in this homework are about jupyter, APIs, git and GitHub. I used APIs to retrieve information and did some analysis from two datasets: Weather and Last FM.

#### What have I learned?
Well, from this homework, I learned that no matter how easy you think the assignment is, you have to read the questions and the APIs' documentations very very very carefully! Never skip one single line or word!


#### Did I find it challenging?
Well, after finishing it, I didn't find it challenging. But it took me tons of time because I forgot how to apply some functions and how to sum up values in a list. I had to look into previous assignments to find the answers.
